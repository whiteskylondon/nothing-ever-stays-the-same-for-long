    "commentary": "This video explores the way cities reflect themselvesâ€”not just in glass and water, but in the patterns of movement and light that define urban experience. The camera moves through spaces that seem familiar yet strange, revealing the hidden geometries of everyday life. Each frame captures a moment of recognition, where the built environment reveals its deeper structure."

    "commentary": "Time moves differently in different places. This video examines how landscapes change not just with the seasons, but with the passage of light, weather, and human activity. The camera becomes a witness to these temporal shifts, capturing moments of transformation that might otherwise go unnoticed. The result is a meditation on the relationship between permanence and change."
